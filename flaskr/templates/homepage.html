    <h1>Welcome to the Collatz Conjecture</h1>
    <p>
        The Collatz conjecture is a famous mathematical sequence, named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz.
        It involves taking any positive integer and following a simple set of rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the number is even, divide it by 2.</li>
        <li>If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the resulting number until the number reaches 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Despite its simple rules, the conjecture remains unsolved. It has been tested for very large numbers, but no one has been able to prove it true for all integers.
